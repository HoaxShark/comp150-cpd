# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

I’ve included the Sunday as the Meet your Mentor session was on this day. I attended thinking it would be good to meet some people before hand as im not based on campus.
I found the activities interesting if a bit disorganised, but what I really liked was being in a room full of people where games jokes and talk was natural to everyone, this isn’t something I had experienced in person before in such a large group.

Monday - Tuesday were introductory talks that were partly informative and slightly repetitive however it was good time spent socialising and I had chances to meet more people on the other games courses.

Wednesday - Friday was spent doing a lego olympiad, this was our first group project and I immediately came across problems having my ideas listened to, being allowed to get involved in the building and a lack of effort from some team members. I feel like I managed to not push my ideas too hard as I could see there would be no change, I instead tried to work with the team while still attempting to improve where I thought we could. I ended up taking the approach of implementing my ideas while the other team members were away and making sure to tell them on return that if they still didn’t agree that we could very easily remove my changes. However they ended up liking the changes and they were kept. For the last day the team members I found hardest to work with didn’t show up and me and the other member I feel were instantly more productive. I think this shows just how much the group dynamic can cause projects to go slower and more stressful depending on how well people work together.


## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

Monday - Tuesday: I enjoyed coming up with game concepts on the monday, I didn’t find it too difficult which I was a bit surprised about, having others to bounce ideas off really helps.
Tuesday we have set into teams and my team is working really smoothly, I feel like everyone is listened too and we tend to combine ideas, but i’m trying to look out and make sure I am open to others ideas and a good team member. We also did paired programming for the first time and saw some python code, although the python we went over I had done before it's nice hearing about it with the extra explanations from the lecturer. I’m also instantly a fan of pair programming, having another person to help spot mistakes as you go and vice verses really helps save time on debugging.
Wednesday - Thursday: These days we did our first group sessions working from home, it worked really well, although some people were late and didn’t hang around for the entire session it was very productive. For me it’s great as it saves the journey and I find it easier working on my own PC than the studio ones.
Friday - I stayed home friday as I hadn’t been feeling very well towards the end of the week, I felt a bit guilty but was in no shape to focus on work, and just resigned myself to going over the slides from sessions once I felt better.


## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

Got a new pair programming partner who missed the previous lessons, he didn’t know what pair programming was and had a great grasp on coding already so I ended up just trying to solo the lesson, managed to catch up on the lesson missed last week and hand in my work. Been given research tasks which is a whole new thing to me but looking forward to trying it out. I’m going to try and talk to my pair and explain the concept of pair programming.

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

I got the game I most wanted to work on out of the ones that were funded, sadly some of the team members want to take the game in a more combat focused manner, even after getting feedback about this maybe not being right for our target market they still wanted it. We have had another successful work from home session with us all on voice chat, those pushing the combat aspect of the game didn’t join the session so we managed to go back to the core focus of exploration with the game design. I did my game pitch this week, I enjoyed coming up with the game concept even though it was a bit stressful at times. Tried to explain to my paired partner the idea of paired programming, had spent a bit of time out of class talking to him and felt more comfortable, we still didn’t really do paired programming, though he did offer to do it later in the lesson I just felt a bit inadequate. Started reading the research journals available for one of our tasks and I have no idea.

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

I’ve taken on the role of scrum master, I was quite happy to do it as i’m decent at organising times with people and communicating to make sure everyone is doing alright. It’s going well so far with everyone in the team making an effort to show or let us know if they can’t make something. Working on my comp120 contract has been tricky, I have got it working though it’s likely in the worst possible way. I have another way I would like to do it when I find time, and after the peer review I may even find better ways from people's advice. I have been making sure to put forward my work when peer reviews are available as i find i learn a lot more if people talk to me about what i could change or should change in the work i have done.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

Me and Beren (paired partner) decided to change some of the code in our contract the day before the deadline, I was up for it because I wanted to learn a better way to do what I had done with messy code. We ended up working on it up until an hour before deadline, I found this quite stressful rushing towards the deadline and will endeavour to not make massive changes the day before deadline. Life as scrum master is good we haven’t had much issue with people not showing to our meeting times, and the one blocker we have had so far I feel I worked well to organise the team to remove it asap. 

## Week 6

For this week I spent the first half in the studio working with my team, we managed to storm through the sprint targets, we ended up having to take more stories from the backlog, I think we should look at having more choosen to do in the planning meeting as we had a bit of trouble with people not being sure what to work on next. For the second half I stayed home to work on my research essay, I find the studio very loud esspically when everyone was there and its not an enviroment I choose compared to home. I've been struggling with the research work as I feel quite lost, though I have started setting myself timed sessions where I force myself to look more into it.
On the last day we all got together and medled our work into one, we found out this day that on the coming monday we needed a group presentation to be handed in, so we planned to do our slides personally on the weekend and merge them together.

## Week 7

Start of tinker audio - Essay when not in lectures main essay push for peer reviews. Felt slightly stressed about completing enough work for the peer review sessions but made sure to relax and have enough time to only work when it felt productive. Slacked on my scrum master roles as we have all been doing essay work instead of group project work. New paired programming partner, haven’t done any work out of hours yet.


## Week 8

Essay completion week - Had driving cours. Still no work out of hours with new programing partner, I’ve been focused on the essays but need to manage my time in a way I can keep up to date with all projects

### Term 2

## Week 1

Was informed about the different module assignments 
Started basics of C++ with Brian and looking into some alt controllers 
Learnt about quality and risk management
Have gotten some help on the unreal team game where I had been stuck.
First unreal lesson was covering stuff we had to self teach already
First PO meeting in a while, discussed that our communication sucks and need to work on it.
Learnt that in the studio avoid the i3’s at all costs the compiling time is too much on them and you may as well just go to bed instead of being in.

## Week 2

Started Arduino’s. New stuff to learn regarding electronics but seems really interesting. Trying to think of an idea for a custom controller have one but want something else.
Tuesday I merged the different projects into one because it was taking too long for it to be done beren
Wednesday snow day no do anything!
Thursday spent the day with the team and got the game and learnt blocking out on unreal. We stayed to make sure the game had a working build with things rdy for review on friday
Friday stayed home to collect something important. Missed the PO sadly and turns out our project broke.

## Week 3

Got a better idea for my alt controller game
Team cohesion its going a bit better this week, times for stand ups etc are being sorted in advance.
Managed some more work on the group project
Went awol for the last 3 days of the week, was feeling shitty (quitting smoking took it out of me). Spent minimal time working on time working from home, but made sure not to miss any lectures or the PO meeting

## Week 4

Feeling much better, finished the lecture work after lesson working along with mango louie and adrian, would be crazy tricky without their help. But i feel like i'm learning.
Making it to all stand ups and staying to work on the group project. Not that hard when the stand ups are basically non existent though

## Week 5

## Week 6

This week has been a game project week, it’s really hammered home to me how little the group are interested in the game. Day one was me and adrian for most of it. Day two no difference and past that I just worked from home because it felt pointless to travel and work in a less comfortable environment when the team wasn’t there anyway. This experience has really killed my interest in the group project. We are getting no guidance from the designers as to what they want, we just add whatever we want, and they may complain about it later. 

## Week 7

We had the show and tell, it was interesting in part to see everyones games, for our year i could see a bit of a gap between the unity projects and the unreal one, unity looking more polished already. I think this is just due to experience. Show and tell comes down to marketing in my eyes, would much rather get to try these games and see what they are really like. We did our software presentations as well, I made it through, luckily no one else has any idea, expect the lecturers and they just added good avenues for me to research into which was great. I made sure to take into account my previous feedback on presentation though, so hopefully that came off better.

## Week 8

This week was focused mainly on my software engineering essay, I really struggled with this one, I didn’t feel like I had any idea what i was writing about, was just kinda making sure i had done something. Its pretty sad to be at that point, nothing seemed to click this time like it has with previous essays. Maybe i should have picked a topic i knew more about already or was more interested in, but with such a wide scope i struggled to choose and ended up just going with something i thought i could grasp. Either way its all done and handed in.

## Week 9

I missed some lectures this week as I wasn’t very well, I intend to catch up with the work that I missed though. As ever the studio practices are empty when it comes to our team. Coming back from break is always a bit slow going and it really didn’t help not feeling well
 
## Week 10

This week has been a bit of crunch, have been in with the team working on making sure the game is ready and working, its really annoying that only now are more of the team interested. There are a lot of requests to change things and it feels like had these been asked about earlier we would be in a much better place. But we are doing what we can and trying to stop too much late content creep, but some of the content is pretty needed. We showed our games too in one of the bsc classes, ours has changed a lot since the show and tell and was good to see people enjoying it. I got my 3d model printed and have done all the wiring and soldering, was really enjoyable actually, making something physical is rather fun.

## Week 11

Group game project was handed in, feels nice to have it done with, controller project also handed in. All that's left is the CPD stuff which should be alright. I should really have started sooner with my controller project, would have given me more time to fix slight issues, but overall i'm pleased with what I made. We were set a summer project just to come up with a world idea that a game could be set in. It’ll be interesting to do.

## Week 12

Lecture on some more design patterns was interesting but due to missing one of the classes before hand I didn’t get some of what was brought to the lecture. Been thinking about my CPD what sort of stuff interests me, it's tricky to be sure, im thinking maybe VR/AR as it does interest me anyway, but next year when we get to work with that i’ll have a better idea.
 
## Week 13

Vivas this week along with handing in the CPD
