# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

I’ve included the Sunday as the Meet your Mentor session was on this day. I attended thinking it would be good to meet some people before hand as im not based on campus.
I found the activities interesting if a bit disorganised, but what I really liked was being in a room full of people where games jokes and talk was natural to everyone, this isn’t something I had experienced in person before in such a large group.

Monday - Tuesday were introductory talks that were partly informative and slightly repetitive however it was good time spent socialising and I had chances to meet more people on the other games courses.

Wednesday - Friday was spent doing a lego olympiad, this was our first group project and I immediately came across problems having my ideas listened to, being allowed to get involved in the building and a lack of effort from some team members. I feel like I managed to not push my ideas too hard as I could see there would be no change, I instead tried to work with the team while still attempting to improve where I thought we could. I ended up taking the approach of implementing my ideas while the other team members were away and making sure to tell them on return that if they still didn’t agree that we could very easily remove my changes. However they ended up liking the changes and they were kept. For the last day the team members I found hardest to work with didn’t show up and me and the other member I feel were instantly more productive. I think this shows just how much the group dynamic can cause projects to go slower and more stressful depending on how well people work together.


## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

Monday - Tuesday: I enjoyed coming up with game concepts on the monday, I didn’t find it too difficult which I was a bit surprised about, having others to bounce ideas off really helps.
Tuesday we have set into teams and my team is working really smoothly, I feel like everyone is listened too and we tend to combine ideas, but i’m trying to look out and make sure I am open to others ideas and a good team member. We also did paired programming for the first time and saw some python code, although the python we went over I had done before it's nice hearing about it with the extra explanations from the lecturer. I’m also instantly a fan of pair programming, having another person to help spot mistakes as you go and vice verses really helps save time on debugging.
Wednesday - Thursday: These days we did our first group sessions working from home, it worked really well, although some people were late and didn’t hang around for the entire session it was very productive. For me it’s great as it saves the journey and I find it easier working on my own PC than the studio ones.
Friday - I stayed home friday as I hadn’t been feeling very well towards the end of the week, I felt a bit guilty but was in no shape to focus on work, and just resigned myself to going over the slides from sessions once I felt better.


## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

Got a new pair programming partner who missed the previous lessons, he didn’t know what pair programming was and had a great grasp on coding already so I ended up just trying to solo the lesson, managed to catch up on the lesson missed last week and hand in my work. Been given research tasks which is a whole new thing to me but looking forward to trying it out. I’m going to try and talk to my pair and explain the concept of pair programming.

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

I got the game I most wanted to work on out of the ones that were funded, sadly some of the team members want to take the game in a more combat focused manner, even after getting feedback about this maybe not being right for our target market they still wanted it. We have had another successful work from home session with us all on voice chat, those pushing the combat aspect of the game didn’t join the session so we managed to go back to the core focus of exploration with the game design. I did my game pitch this week, I enjoyed coming up with the game concept even though it was a bit stressful at times. Tried to explain to my paired partner the idea of paired programming, had spent a bit of time out of class talking to him and felt more comfortable, we still didn’t really do paired programming, though he did offer to do it later in the lesson I just felt a bit inadequate. Started reading the research journals available for one of our tasks and I have no idea.

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

I’ve taken on the role of scrum master, I was quite happy to do it as i’m decent at organising times with people and communicating to make sure everyone is doing alright. It’s going well so far with everyone in the team making an effort to show or let us know if they can’t make something. Working on my comp120 contract has been tricky, I have got it working though it’s likely in the worst possible way. I have another way I would like to do it when I find time, and after the peer review I may even find better ways from people's advice. I have been making sure to put forward my work when peer reviews are available as i find i learn a lot more if people talk to me about what i could change or should change in the work i have done.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

Me and Beren (paired partner) decided to change some of the code in our contract the day before the deadline, I was up for it because I wanted to learn a better way to do what I had done with messy code. We ended up working on it up until an hour before deadline, I found this quite stressful rushing towards the deadline and will endeavour to not make massive changes the day before deadline. Life as scrum master is good we haven’t had much issue with people not showing to our meeting times, and the one blocker we have had so far I feel I worked well to organise the team to remove it asap. 

## Week 6

For this week I spent the first half in the studio working with my team, we managed to storm through the sprint targets, we ended up having to take more stories from the backlog, I think we should look at having more choosen to do in the planning meeting as we had a bit of trouble with people not being sure what to work on next. For the second half I stayed home to work on my research essay, I find the studio very loud esspically when everyone was there and its not an enviroment I choose compared to home. I've been struggling with the research work as I feel quite lost, though I have started setting myself timed sessions where I force myself to look more into it.
On the last day we all got together and medled our work into one, we found out this day that on the coming monday we needed a group presentation to be handed in, so we planned to do our slides personally on the weekend and merge them together.
